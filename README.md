# 11ty Boilerplate

Super basic [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) starter to get you moving in the right direction and gently introduce some core features like **Passthrough File Copy** for handling images and stylesheets, **layouts**, and templating with [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) and [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org).

## Quickstart

1. Create a new repository in your own account from this template.
2. Open the new repository in Codespaces or your own development environment.
3. Make sure you have Node.js installed (this will be automatic if using Codespaces).
4. In your terminal type `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` to build and view the template.

## Lab 10 Rubric
1. Create a new base 11ty site starting from the class GitHub 11ty Boilerplate. Make sure you create a new repository based on the template repo (see first video): [11ty-boilerplate](https://github.com/msu-webdev/11ty-boilerplate)

2. Create an everyday carry website that features three things you won't leave home without.

3. Each thing should have it's own page, but the full list of things should be available on the homepage.

4. For each thing, provide an original picture (with a camera or your phone), short description of the item, and why you can't leave home without it.

5. The final site must make use of at least one 11ty layout file for the main HTML headers and footers, and one shortcode for reusable content.

6. Your site should include at least 10 CSS rulesets.

7. Your site should have a consistent color palette, look and feel across all pages. The final site should have a new theme that fits the content, please don't reuse the demo CSS in the starter template.

8. Your site should be published to Netlify and public links from GitHub and Netlify should be submitted to D2L.

9. Submit your public URLs to the Module 10 dropbox
